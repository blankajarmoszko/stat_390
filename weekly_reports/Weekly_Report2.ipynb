    "- Performed EDA on original dataset \n",
    "    - Added weekend, holiday, and announcement columns which look to see if there are any surges in vaccinations    corresponding to specific dates. \n",
    "    - Created graphs to visualize response variableâ€™s variation over time.\n",
    "- Found a new dataset with negligible null values especially compared to our original dataset.\n",
    "    - The new dataset will be looking at all states in the US rather than just Illinois counties.\n",
    "    - Our predictor will remain similar and the predictor columns are similar as well with demographic and specific vaccination data.\n",
    "    - This new dataset also has more specific data as the vaccination rates are split by vaccine types (Moderna, Pfizer, etc). This detail can provide more tailored insights with regards to our response variable.\n",
    "- Emailed Professor Shi asking for permission to continue working with the new data.\n",
    "- Conducted group meetings to discuss challenges, perform EDA, and locate suitable dataset.\n",
    "    - For EDA on the new dataset, we added weekend, holiday, and announcement columns\n",
    "    - We also identified columns with NA values, dropped bivariate columns and other columns with high amount of values because it did not impact our prediction, and KNN imputed any remaining columns with NA values\n",
    "    - Dropped columns that represented raw numbers and kept the columns that represented the same thing but were in percentage values\n",
    "    - Performed VIF analysis and looked at correlations to see if there was any high collinearity"

    "- Identified missing values\n",

    "    - Figured out that starting the data with November 2, 2021 resolves data leakage issues as children weren’t allowed to get vaccinated until then\n",
    "    - Successfully imputed the data\n",
    "- Created graphs regarding the autocorrelation to visualize it\n",
    "    - Decided that, for the purpose of visualizing autocorrelation, we will group the rows of different states based on the same date\n",
    "        - We are doing that so that the visualization does not have overlapping data\n",
    "    - Found that there is no clear seasonality trends using Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL)\n",
    "- Tried imputing data based on Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)\n",
    "    - The missing value is imputed using the values before it in the time series\n",
    "    - Decided that was the best method of imputation since we are using time series data\n",
    "    - Figured out that for ten states on December 14, 2022 are missing values\n",
    "    - Decided to impute those values with the last values from December 13, 2023\n",
    "- Based on the autocorrelation graph, found that we have a specific autocorrelation function trend\n",
    "    - The pattern is commonly observed in time series data with a strong short-term memory or persistence. It may imply that the most recent values have a more pronounced impact on the current value, and the impact of earlier values diminishes gradually\n"
